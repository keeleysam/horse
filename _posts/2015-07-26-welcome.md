Welcome! tom.horse is the primary landing page for me, [Tom Cook](https://tom.horse/about/).

Currently tom.horse is the most secure .horse domain name on the Internet, earning an [A+ rating from SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=tom.horse&latest). Not only is it HTTPS by default, but it's part of the HSTS browser [preload list](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/http/transport_security_state_static.json). It also supports HPKP, an emerging standard for validating SSL certificates.
