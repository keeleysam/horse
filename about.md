I'm a freelance SRE/Systems nerd based out of San Francisco, CA. 

I've worked at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Quora](https://www.quora.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), and some smaller technology companies. I've been working as a SysAdmin/SRE/systems engineer for about 15 years and have supported infrastructures with servers numbering in the hundreds of thousands, running applications relied upon by billions of people.

Outside of work I'm interested in the information security world, freedom of speech issues, advancement of civil liberties, my dog, riding bikes, and (occasionally) surfing.
